Everything after the "//" it's only for a quick description.
'''
mkdir Dev 
''' >this will create a "Dev" called folder (or directory) on your root directory, this will be the place to put our Development stuff. You can change the name if you want.

cd Dev //"cd" is used to make everything that we use after this command to be ran on the "Dev" folder.

Inside the "Dev" folder, we can creat subfolders in order to separate and organize different projects, and if you wih, you can create more and more subfolders to maybe use them to separate versions of your codes.

mkdir HelloWorld //this directory will be used as our first project, called "HelloWorld".

clear //It'll clear you terminal screen. **ONLY** use this when you are sick of getting all of that terminal text on your screen **AND** you dont have anything important to take notes from it.
