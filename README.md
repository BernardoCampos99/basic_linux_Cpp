# basic_linux_Cpp
It's always good to know the basics, even if you are a master. That's where everyone begin ^^

In this project, you can learn the basics on how to best setup C++ on a linux machine. In the examples, I will be taking screenshots and executing those on a Virtual Machine of an Ubuntu 20.11.

I'll try my best to explain and detail every step that I take and I will be writing the instructions/tutorial in this readme file, so let's get to it!

First, take a look in the [ubuntu's desktop image](desktop_ubuntu.PNG) file, and click on the "Show Applications" button on the corner of your screen (those 9 dots on the corner). It'll open you Applications tab and show you your installed and recommended apps. click on the search bar and type [terminal](terminal_search.PNG). You'll see this black box with a line on it. Click on it to open the Application.

You'll see a [blank terminal](terminal_first_sight.PNG) and those white pieces can change depending on your username and the virtual machine PC name.
